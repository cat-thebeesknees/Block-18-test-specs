## Unit Tests:
## A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers:

## multiplication (3, 2) should be a number.
## multiplication (3, 2) should be equal to 6.
## multiplication (3a, 2) should be an error.

## A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays:

## concatOdds ([8, 9, 4, 6], [12, 1, 6, 8, 10, 9]  should result in [1, 9]
## concatOdds ([8, 9, 4, 6], [12, 1, 6, 8, 10, 9] should be an []
## concatOdds ([8, 9, 4, 6], [12, 1, 6, 8, 10, 9] should not return even numbers

## Functional Tests:
## A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest:

## When user adds an item to the cart, they are prompted to login, create an account, or continue as a guest.
## When user logs in to their account, they are asked to provide their email and password. They may click a reset link if they've forgotten their password.
## When user creates an account, they must choose a password containing letters and at least one number.
## If user tries to create a password without a number, they recieve an error message.
## When user adds an item to the cart, any available coupons automatically apply to the total.
## If user needs to spend more more to recieve a discount, a message is displayed telling the user how much more they need to spend to recieve a discount.
